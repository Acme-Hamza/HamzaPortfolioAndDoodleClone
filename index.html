                    <p>Hi I'm Hamza, the reserved yet bold can of fire. As soon as I'm comfortable with you I become a hyperactive force to be reckoned with.
                        Full of energy and creativity, that's what makes me a great programmer. I come up with many great ideas and think of the right questions
                        that need to be solved to come up with the right answers to truly build something incredible. On my journey of honing my coding skills,
                        my goal is to become a certified full-stack engineer. I've learned many coding languages but I still have much work to do. I need to
                        improve my technical skills and knowledge. Through experience and codecademy's resources I continue to do so. 
                    </p>
                    <p>When I first started coding I was trying to learn how to create video games with python and although there were several unfinished projects,
                        it caused me to learn so much through trial and error. I even made a simple laser beam dodge game, which was my first successful project.
                        Eventually I started learning how to use unreal engine and although I have come up with some interesting concepts, making the game I had
                        in mind was a longshot. I have created and implemented some rpg-like concepts but couldn't really build an entire game on my own.
                    </p>
                    <p>Besides coding, I am a very active person, whom priotizes a healthy lifestyle through fitness and nutrition.
                        I like to run and go on walks which helps me after a long coding session where I am seated throughout it.
                        I forgot to mention that I am 21 years old and enjoy video games and anime which are the things that actually inspired me to 
                        become a programmer and workout. Overall I enjoy self-improvement and becoming better than I was a day ago.
                    </p>

                        <li class="project">1. Side Scroll Platformer</li>
                        <br>
                        <p>Using the pygame library in Python, I coded a 2d platformer video game
                            inspired by "Super Mario Bros". The objective is simply to make it
                        through various obstacles as you attempt reaching the end of the level. </p>
                        <br>
                        <li class="project">2. Turn Based RPG</li>
                        <br>
                        <p>A passion project of mine was to make my very own turn based rpg. I made unique passive skills and ultimate skills for different "characters"
                            and a stat system. It is still in progress and I hope to someday bring it to life. Right now it is currently
                            only powered by javascript with some html to provide testing. However I want it to have original art
                            and graphically pleasing visuals to be more exciting. With this project I plan on focusing on player enjoyment,
                            instead of the usual restrictions on leveling and accesibility to characters that most games like this have.
                            The monetization will be through cosmetics not gameplay. It is currently a dream but my eyes won't stay shut.
                            I am in need of a passionate artist and although I think I can start on my own I'd need assistants to help update the game
                            and improve user experience. 
                        </p>

                        <li class="project">3. Laser Dodge</li>
                        <br>
                        <p>The very first video game I coded, the reason I say coded is because I recall creating a video game using block code
                            in high school. And I actually learned basic python back in high school which is what I used to make this game.
                            While experimenting with pygame I learned just enough to create a never ending laser dodge game that ramps up in difficulty the longer you survive up
                            up to a certain point. I implemented a score tracker and a pause button as well. If I were to add anything else it'd be powerups and better visuals.
                            The game looked dull. I used a space background and the lasers were just purple rectangle like pixels and the player was a larger green rectangle. 
                        </p>
