Make item drops for the game and maybe use potara earrings to increase "Ki" when ki reaches 100% Transform into Rose.
Transformation steadily causes ki to drop and when it reaches a certain point maybe 0 the Transformation is undone.
Rose will increase the score multiplier. Finding "time rings" will give the player more time.
